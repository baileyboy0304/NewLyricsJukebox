# Changelog

## 1.0.3

- Log the running version at startup (`=== NewLyricsJukebox version X.Y.Z ===`)
  and add a `/health` endpoint returning the version, so it's possible to confirm
  which build a Home Assistant install is actually running. (Add-on `config.yaml`
  network changes only take effect on Update/Rebuild, not a plain restart.)

## 1.0.2

- Fix inaccessible web UI (sidebar ingress and direct URL): removed
  `host_network`, which is incompatible with Home Assistant ingress. The add-on
  now runs on the standard add-on network with `9014/tcp` (UI) and `6056/udp`
  (RTP audio) mapped explicitly. UDP player identity comes from the RTP
  SSRC/extension, so port-mapped UDP works without the host network.

## 1.0.1

- Fix blank page under Home Assistant ingress: assets and API calls now use
  relative URLs so the UI works both behind the ingress path prefix and at the
  server root (direct `:9014`).

## 1.0.0

- Clean rebuild of NewLyricsJukebox (see `REBUILD_NOTES.md`).
- `classify_source_mode()` spine: queue-based (Music Assistant metadata) vs
  stream-based (UDP audio recognition).
- RTP-only UDP capture with per-player demux; Shazam → ACRCloud recognition with
  the "3 attempts before locked" cycle and persisted ACRCloud daily quota.
- All lyrics providers kept (LRCLIB, Spotify, Musixmatch, NetEase, QQ) with
  two-pass selection and the per-song JSON DB; per-player state (no module
  globals).
- Web UI on port 9014: player-select modal, now-playing, 3-line lyrics,
  transport bar with flywheel-clock sync.
